            <h2>Currently</h2>
            <h3>Spitzer School of Architecture (City College of New York)</h3>
            <p><em>August 2021 - May 2024 (expected)</em></p>
            <p>I am enrolled in a three-year <a href="https://ssa.ccny.cuny.edu/programs-centers/graduate-programs/m-arch-i/">Master of Architecture program at Spitzer</a>,
            part of New York's public university system.</p>
            <p>Architecture sits at at the intersection of human and material requirements,
            similar to the software projects I've worked on in the past.
            Buildings, cities, and environments as executed by architects are only successful when they meet both sets of demands.
            In the M Arch I program, I'm learning to strike that balance as I sharpen my design and research skills in the studio and classroom.</p>
            <p>Through my studio work, I'm tackling problems taken directly from the streets of New York City:
            exploring how the cityscape can be a place of care,
            particularly for people traditionally underserved by public space.
            I'm gaining experience with Rhino, Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, &amp; InDesign, and Esri ArcGIS,
            in addition to studying materials, structural physics, and architectural history.</p>
            <h2>Where I’ve Been</h2>
            <h3>Etsy Inc. (Brooklyn, New York)</h3>
            <p><em>Senior Staff Software Engineer, March 2018 - June 2021<br />
            Staff Software Engineer, March 2015 - March 2018<br />
            Senior Software Engineer, November 2013 - March 2015</em></p>
            <p><a href="https://etsy.com">https://etsy.com</a></p>
            <p>In my time at Etsy, I've worked on both infrastructure and user-facing features,
            in a variety of areas,
            using PHP, Java, and Scala on the server and Javascript, HTML, and SCSS on the client.
            As a Senior Staff Engineer, I'm a member of the engineering organization's leadership group,
            helping to create a positive and productive culture that ships great software.
            I've been responsible for a variety of engineering and product development tasks
            centered around making the Etsy marketplace more successful.</p>
            <p>I work with other engineers, product managers, designers, and more
            to deliver software that is fast, easy to use, and reliable.
            I serve not only as a key engineer, writing production code daily,
            but also as a technical leader,
            making technical decisions and directing the work of as many as six other engineers.</p>
            <p>I've worked on several major infratructure initiatives that fundamentally changed Etsy's systems.
            In 2018 and 2019, I led the engineering work to migrate Etsy's search infrastructure to Google Cloud.
            We re-platformed the multi-service architecture from running on bare metal to Kubernetes,
            providing a scalable foundation while improving reliability and operability.
            My work involved not only planning and system design but also execution of substantial technical work,
            while managing the team's backlog and ensuring the migration completed on time and on budget.</p>
            <p>Earlier, I rebuilt Etsy's email dispatch system,
            which wass responsible for rendering and sending all mail outbound from Etsy.
            The rewrite increased send speed
            from under 100 emails per second
            to over 2000 emails per second.
            In its first year in production,
            the new system sent over three billion emails.
            I also developed a framework
            for <a href="http://codeascraft.com/2014/03/13/responsive-emails-that-really-work/">building responsive emails</a>,
            enabling engineers and designers throughout the company
            to make attractive, well-performing emails.</p>
            <p>As part of the Buyer Experience and Etsy.com teams,
            I worked on several large, user-facing projects,
            including Etsy's homepage, product listing page, and sitewide navigation.
            These projects increased sales and see tens of millions of hits per day.</p>
            <p>I'm particularly proud of the <a href="https://www.etsy.com/featured">Editors' Picks</a> project,
            which enables Etsy's marketing team
            to create, publish, and promote themed pages
            of products from around the marketplace.
            This involved planning, designing, and building an internal CMS;
            full-stack buyer-facing development;
            implementing APIs to power our mobile apps;
            and adding monitoring and tooling to keep things running smoothly.
            The marketing team has published over a thousand curated Editors' Picks pages
            for Etsy's worldwide marketplace.</p>
            <h3>Fog Creek Software (now Glitch, Inc., New York, New York)</h3>
            <p><em>June 2009 - October 2013</em></p>
            <p><a href="https://glitch.com">https://glitch.com</a><br />
            </p>
            <p>I was on the Kiln team at Fog Creek from its inception.  Kiln (now spun off as FogBugz Dev Hub) is a source code managment web application built atop Mercurial and Git.  The project involved server-side coding in C# in the ASP.NET MVC framework and front-end work in Javascript, CSS/LESS, and HTML.  Additionally, parts of Kiln that interact with Mercurial and Git are written in Python.</p>
            <p>Working on Kiln took me across a wide spectrum of development, from web apps to native, from UI designs to database optimization, from build and monitoring scripts to support tools and automated tests.</p>
            <p>From June to August 2009, I participated in Fog Creek's summer software development internship program.  As part of a team of interns and full-time employees, I helped to develop Kiln from a specification to 1.0 product in ten weeks.  I then continued work on Kiln as a full-time Member of Technical Staff.</p>
            <p>From April 2012, I served as Kiln Team Lead, guiding the product's development and managing the team of two to seven developers.  This involved working closely with the system administration, sales, and support teams to deliver a world-class product.  My horizons broadened from full-time development to a satisfying mix of planning, mentorship, and development.</p>
            <p>Some of my proudest accomplishments include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Adding support for Git alongside Mercurial, including implementing large parts of Kiln Harmony, an on-the-fly converter from Mercurial to Git and back.</li>
            <li>Replacing Kiln's SQL-backed search engine with elasticsearch, resulting in a thousand-fold speedup. In September 2013, InfoQ published my article <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/kiln-elasticsearch">"How Fog Creek Software Made Kiln's Search 1000x Faster with Elasticsearch"</a> about this project.</li>
            <li>Porting a Windows Forms application to OS X, preserving the core logic in a shared C# project, with native UI on both platforms.</li>
            <li>Contributing to <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com">Mercurial</a>, including attending the Mercurial 1.9 code sprint in Copehagen, and contributing to other open source projects, such as <a href="https://github.com/Mpdreamz/NEST">NEST</a> and <a href="https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn">gunicorn</a>.</li>
            <li>Leading teams of interns on the same product that I worked on as an intern.  I completed the <a href="http://www.ccl.org/Leadership/programs/mlpoverview.aspx">"Maximizing Your Leadership Potential" program</a> at the Center for Creative Leadership, Greensboro, NC, in May 2013.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>StyleNet provides customizable websites for salons and spas.  For most of my time at StyleNet, I was the sole developer on the 75,000-LOC PHP codebase.  I worked closely with the cofounders on planning new features, despite not meeting them face-to-face for the first 15 months---this was an entirely remote position.</p>
            <p>These features included online appointment scheduling, an internal CMS for clients to manage text and image content on their sites, and backend user management for the company.  I also implemented a variety of templates for the CMS, converting Photoshop comps into live web designs.</p>
            <p>Beyond working on the core StyleNet product, I built public websites and an intranet for a partner company.  For part of this work I had two other remote developers reporting to me.</p>
